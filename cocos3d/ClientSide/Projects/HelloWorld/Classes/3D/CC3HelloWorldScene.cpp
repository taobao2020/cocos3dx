/**
 * Constructs the 3D scene prior to the scene being displayed.
 *
 * Adds 3D objects to the scene, loading a 3D 'hello, world' message
 * from a POD file, and creating the camera and light programatically.
 *
 * When adapting this template to your application, remove all of the content
 * of this method, and add your own to construct your 3D model scene.
 *
 * You can also load scene content asynchronously while the scene is being displayed by
 * loading on a background thread. You can add code that loads content to the 
 * addSceneContentAsynchronously method, and it will automatically be loaded immediately
 * after the scene is opened, and smoothly inserted into the scene, as the existing scene
 * content is being displayed.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1) To help you find your scene content once it is loaded, the onOpen method below contains
 *    code to automatically move the camera so that it frames the scene. You can remove that
 *    code once you know where you want to place your camera.
 *
 * 2) The POD file used for the 'hello, world' message model is fairly large, because converting a
 *    font to a mesh results in a LOT of triangles. When adapting this template project for your own
 *    application, REMOVE the POD file 'hello-world.pod' from the Resources folder of your project.

	// With complex scenes, the drawing of objects that are not within view of the camera will
	// consume GPU resources unnecessarily, and potentially degrading app performance. We can
	// avoid drawing objects that are not within view of the camera by assigning a bounding
	// volume to each mesh node. Once assigned, the bounding volume is automatically checked
	// to see if it intersects the camera's frustum before the mesh node is drawn. If the node's
	// bounding volume intersects the camera frustum, the node will be drawn. If the bounding
	// volume does not intersect the camera's frustum, the node will not be visible to the camera,
	// and the node will not be drawn. Bounding volumes can also be used for collision detection
	// between nodes. You can create bounding volumes automatically for most rigid (non-skinned)
	// objects by using the createBoundingVolumes on a node. This will create bounding volumes
	// for all decendant rigid mesh nodes of that node. Invoking the method on your scene will
	// create bounding volumes for all rigid mesh nodes in the scene. Bounding volumes are not
	// automatically created for skinned meshes that modify vertices using bones. Because the
	// vertices can be moved arbitrarily by the bones, you must create and assign bounding
	// volumes to skinned mesh nodes yourself, by determining the extent of the bounding
	// volume you need, and creating a bounding volume that matches it. Finally, checking
	// bounding volumes involves a small computation cost. For objects that you know will be
	// in front of the camera at all times, you can skip creating a bounding volume for that
	// node, letting it be drawn on each frame. Since the automatic creation of bounding
	// volumes depends on having the vertex location content in memory, be sure to invoke
	// this method before invoking the releaseRedundantContent method.

 *
 * This method is invoked automatically by the drawScene method, once the 3D environment has

 * re-established automatically, and any 2D billboard overlays will be rendered. This method
 * does not need to take care of any of this set-up and tear-down.
 *
 * This implementation simply invokes the default parent behaviour, which turns on the lighting
 * contained within the scene, and performs a single rendering pass of the nodes in the scene 
 * by invoking the visit: method on the specified visitor, with this scene as the argument.
 * Review the source code of the CC3Scene drawSceneContentWithVisitor: to understand the
 * implementation details, and as a starting point for customization.
 *
 * You can override this method to customize the scene rendering flow, such as performing
 * multiple rendering passes on different surfaces, or adding post-processing effects, using
 * the template methods mentioned above.
 *
 * Rendering output is directed to the render surface held in the renderSurface property of
 * the visitor. By default, that is set to the render surface held in the viewSurface property
 * of this scene. If you override this method, you can set the renderSurface property of the
 * visitor to another surface, and then invoke this superclass implementation, to render this
 * scene to a texture for later processing.
 *
 * When overriding the drawSceneContentWithVisitor: method with your own specialized rendering,
 * steps, be careful to avoid recursive loops when rendering to textures and environment maps.
 * For example, you might typically override drawSceneContentWithVisitor: to include steps to
 * render environment maps for reflections, etc. In that case, you should also override the
 * drawSceneContentForEnvironmentMapWithVisitor: to render the scene without those additional
 * steps, to avoid the inadvertenly invoking an infinite recursive rendering of a scene to a
 * texture while the scene is already being rendered to that texture.
 *
 * To maintain performance, by default, the depth buffer of the surface is not specifically
 * cleared when 3D drawing begins. If this scene is drawing to a surface that already has
 * depth information rendered, you can override this method and clear the depth buffer before
 * continuing with 3D drawing, by invoking clearDepthContent on the renderSurface of the visitor,
 * and then invoking this superclass implementation, or continuing with your own drawing logic.
 *
 * Examples of when the depth buffer should be cleared are when this scene is being drawn
 * on top of other 3D content (as in a sub-window), or when any 2D content that is rendered
 * behind the scene makes use of depth drawing. See also the closeDepthTestWithVisitor:
 * method for more info about managing the depth buffer.
