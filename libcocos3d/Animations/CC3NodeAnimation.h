 * A CC3NodeAnimation manages the animation of a node.

 * to its CC3NodeAnimation when the establishAnimationFrameAt: method is invoked on the node.
 *
 * Animations define animated content in in a series of frames (often called key-frames),
 * and can be configured to interpolate the animated state between these frames if necessary,
 * ensuring smooth animation, regardless of how many, or how widely spaced, the frames of
 * actual animated content are.
 *
 * A single CC3NodeAnimation instance can be shared by multiple nodes. This is a typical
 * situation when creating many copies of a node that is animated.
 *
 * CC3NodeAnimation is an abstract class. Subclasses define concrete animation data storage.

/** 
 * A concrete CC3NodeAnimation that holds animation data in simple arrays.
 * The arrays can be allocated and managed either by the instance, or externally.
 *
 * There are three properties that hold the animated content:
 *   - animatedLocations - location animation content
 *   - animatedQuaternions - rotation quaternion animation content
 *   - animatedScales - scale animation content
 *
 * You do not need to use all of these properties. You can choose to animate any subset of
 * these animation data properties, and leave the remaining animation data properties set to
 * NULL (the default). If you do not set an animation data property, the corresponding property
 * on the node will not be animated, and will retain its originally set value.
 *
 * For example, if you set only the animatedLocations property, and run a CC3ActionAnimate on the node,
 * only the location of the node will move around during the animation. The remaining node
 * properties (quaternion & scale) will remain unchanged by the animation. The effect will be
 * that the node moves around, but remains at a fixed size, and oriented in a fixed rotation.
 *
 * This animation can be configured so that time interval between frames can vary from frame
 * to frame, or that the time interval between frames is constant. To configure for variable
 * frame timing, use the frameTimes property to assign a specific time to each frame. To
 * configure for equally-spaced frames, set the frameTimes property to NULL.
 *
 * You can work with these animation content properties in one of two ways:
 *   - Allocate the arrays outside this class and simply assign them to this instance using the
 *     property accessors. In this case, it is up to you to allocate and deallocate the memory
 *     used by the arrays.
 *   - Invoke one or more of the methods allocateFrameTimes, allocateLocations, allocateQuaternions,
 *     and allocateScales to instruct this instance to allocate and manage the memory for the content
 *     array. You can then access the associated array via the frameTimes, animatedLocations,
 *     animatedQuaternions, and animatedScales properties respectively. This instance will take
 *     care of releasing the arrays when appropriate.
